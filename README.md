# pyCams
We have files created by the security camer and hosted on the device. Scan for faces, try and match known.
In addition, the cameras seem to be unable to manage the files on device.  To manage these files, we need a thread checking age or drive capacity (or both) and keeping the drive maintained.

# Installation -- Ubuntu
